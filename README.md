# jQuery-to-do-list

This a fully functional, jQuery-based "TO DO list app." You can add items to the list, cross them off, and delete them. The index file 
with partial code was provided from my professor in my Intro to Internet Computing Class. It was modified to allow the user to cross items
of the list and delete them. These features weren't included. The design layout was a bootstrap package from bootstraptaste. They did not include 
a license text file with the package.
